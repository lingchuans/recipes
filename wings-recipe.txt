Ingredients
SERVINGS: MAKES ABOUT 60
Buffalo Sauce
1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's)
Ginger-Soy Glaze
1/4 cup honey
2 tablespoons soy sauce
3 large garlic cloves, crushed
1 2x1' piece of ginger, peeled, sliced
Wings
5 pounds chicken wings, tips removed, drumettes and flats separated
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 tablespoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

Preparation
Buffalo Sauce
Mix first 4 ingredients in a medium bowl; let stand for 5 minutes. Whisk in hot sauce; keep warm. 
DO AHEAD: Can be made 1 week ahead. Let cool completely; cover and chill. Rewarm before using.

Ginger-Soy Glaze
Bring all ingredients and 1/4 cup water to a boil in a small saucepan, stirring to dissolve honey. 
Reduce heat to low; simmer, stirring occasionally, until reduced to 1/4 cup, 7–8 minutes. Strain 
into a medium bowl. Let sit for 15 minutes to thicken slightly. DO AHEAD: Can be made 5 days ahead. 
Cover; chill. Rewarm before using.

Wings
Preheat oven to 400°. Set a wire rack inside each of 2 large rimmed baking sheets. Place all 
ingredients in a large bowl; toss to coat. Divide wings between prepared racks and spread out in a 
single layer.
Bake wings until cooked through and skin is crispy, 45–50 minutes.
Line another rimmed baking sheet with foil; top with a wire rack. Add half of wings to ginger-soy 
glaze and toss to evenly coat. Place wings in a single layer on prepared rack and bake until glaze 
is glossy and lightly caramelized, 8–10 minutes.
Toss remaining half of wings in Buffalo sauce. Serve immediately (no need to bake).
